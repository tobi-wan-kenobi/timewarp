Most importantly: Many thanks for considering contributing to timewarp!

One thing I need to mention: This is a project I am working on in my (limited) spare time. I try very hard to answer bug tickets and review Pull Requests as quickly as possible, but it might take days, in some cases even weeks, until I get around to doing so. I want to give every contribution the attention it deserves. Really: I am not ignoring you, I'm simply slow :-)

### Filing a Bug
If you want to file a bug, simply open an issue and describe your problem. Things that help narrow down the problem are:
* Steps to reproduce
* Output of verbose in verbose mode (`-v`)

But even if you can't provide those, any indicator that something is not working as it should is much appreciated!

Thanks for reading until here! :)
